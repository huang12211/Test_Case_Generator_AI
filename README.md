# Test_Case_Generator_AI

## Project: Create a tool that can auto-generate Test Cases from your SWRS

### Set up LangGraph Studio

* LangGraph Studio is a custom IDE for viewing and testing agents.
* Studio can be run locally and opened in your browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
* See documentation [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#local-development-server) on the local Studio development server and [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/local-studio/#run-the-development-server). 
* Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the `module-x/studio/` folders.
* To start the local development server, run the following command in your terminal in the `/studio` directory each module:

```
langgraph dev
```

You should see the following output:
```
- ðŸš€ API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸŽ¨ Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸ“š API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
```

Open your browser and navigate to the Studio UI: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.

## Current Status of Project
- You can ask the AI_Agent to create multiple test cases at a time to cover all of the software requirements that are releated to the feature you want to test. You can then provide it with Human feedback to fill in any holes in the test cases that are generated in the outputs folder.

Note: I have omitted the inputs that I used to run this AI Agent due to the confidential nature of this information.
